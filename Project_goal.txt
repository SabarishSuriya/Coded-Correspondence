Data Science Foundations
Off-Platform Project: Coded Correspondence
Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building.

There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
You and your pen pal, Vishal, have been exchanging letters for some time now. Recently, he has become interested in cryptography and the two of you have started sending encoded messages within your letters.

In this project, you will use your Python skills to decipher the messages you receive and to encode your own responses! Put your programming skills to the test with these fun cryptography puzzles.

Setup
We encourage you to complete this project on your own computer using Jupyter notebooks. To do so, continue following these instructions to get going.

If you’d prefer, you may also use the Codecademy learning environment to do this assignment. Get started by skipping the rest of these setup instructions and instead clicking Start. Then, complete the tasks in the code editor.

To work on this project on your own machine, you will need to use some external tools: the Command Line and Jupyter Notebooks. If you are not familiar with these topics, check out our course on Getting Started Off-Platform for Data Science for help getting set up.

Once you’re ready to begin, click Download to get the zip file containing all of the project files. Extract the files and open coded_correspondence.ipynb to start working! If you get stuck, you can take a look at coded_correspondence_solutions.ipynb for the correct answers.

Note: Be sure to check off the Tasks here on Codecademy even if you are working on this project off-platform. The project will not be considered completed and counted toward your Course or Path Progress until all tasks have been checked off.
